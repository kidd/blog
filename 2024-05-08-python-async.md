I've been a big fan of David Beazley since forever. And there are a
few of his talks I watch and rewatch every now and then.

A few of his amazing talks are:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCs5OvhV9S4 (concurrency)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyDLAutA88s&list=PLKTT4cKtfM9HVQMZoAmkQrCQ1G89mydDl (using the base language)
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27832115 (webassembly)

Today I found this link in HN about concurrency and generators in
python: https://jacobpadilla.com/articles/recreating-asyncio, and
reminded me of an amazing talk I also watch from time to time:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzfHjytDceU and its extended version
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4Gt3Xjd7G8 .


Amazing speaker, and very engaging on any topic he shares with the
crew. Very very recommended, as well as his python course.
