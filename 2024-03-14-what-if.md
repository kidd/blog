title: What if...?
categories: [programming]

From time to time I like to revisit best practices and look for
counterexamples, or success stories of projets that did exactly the
contrary.

Sometimes, just rewriting the opposite, and see how it develops.

I feel it gives ways to discovering non-euclidean programming rules,
and it's pretty fun anyway.

# Programming at max revs
What if programming at the max capacity of your level was ok:

# Write dumb code
Write dumb code: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39503777 , there
are some comments like https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39507108
where kazinator makes the point that some problems are hard, and by
making the code "simple" on the surface, it's not possible depending
on the domain.

There are a few things I see here:
- The [waterbed theory](https://wiki.c2.com/?WaterbedTheory=) on one
  side, where a problem has inherent complexity, and at some point, if
  you push complexity down in one place, it will appear in another, so
  thinking in local optimas is not a good thing.
- Sometimes it's clear, that something is overly "complex", and the
  code could be simpler while doing the same. That is also a very
  personal take on design. Some people don't care about nesting ifs
  and think that they give clear mindmaps, and some other people will
  frown upon them, saying it just clobbers the "meaning" of the
  code. Same with naming vs nesting temporary variables.
- Dumb code (code that any junior can understand) has a trap
  inside. Using less powerful primitives makes repeating oneself a
  part of the deal. Brainfuck is the simplest language I know (it's
  like a turing machine). And even reading bf could be considered
  "easy", in practice, it's not. Higher level constructs help us
  convey meaning in ways that simple code can't.

So "Write Dumb Code", yes, but that sentence is just pushing words
around, not solving the issue.

# Code is not read more times than written
I'm still shocked by this [comment in HN by
gitonthescene](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39613103):

    "In my professional experience most code never gets read by anyone other than
    the original author and when it is read it's often reluctantly. If you
    have any links to studies which show that code is read more often than
    it is written, I'd be interested to read them."

It's something I never thought it could be true, but I respect that
user (he's on the `k` scene, and definitely has coded a lot), so I'm
trying to see how the world looks if this is true.

# Do one thing and do it well

Do one thing and do it well. This is the motto of unix, and a basic
tenet of programming (broader than just in CleanCode).

I've blogged about it before (in my old blog), but Emacs or Perl don't
obvey that, and they do it in a very conscious way. I read the
[foreword to Learning Perl by Larry
Wall](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39731960), and it explains
in such an artistic way why orthogonality is not always the optimal
way to get things done.
