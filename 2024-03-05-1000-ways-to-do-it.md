It's weird that in clojure there is more ways to do the same (at micro
level) than in any other language I've found.

Let's see if in a map, both keys `:a` and `:b` are true.


```clojure
(and (= true (:a h)) (= true (:b h)))                   ;
(= true (:a h) (:b h))
(apply = true [(:a h) (:b h)])
((over (partial every? true?) (juxt :a :b)) {:a 1 :b 2})
((comp (partial every? true?) (juxt :a :b)) {:a 1 :b 2})
(every? true? ((juxt :a :b) {:a true :b false}))
(->> {:a true :b true}
     ((juxt :a :b))
     (every? true?))
(every? {:a true :b "a"} [:a :b])
```


`over` is my attempt to have APL-y
[over](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Over) in clojure. But comp applies
there the same way. In fact, I'm thinking that variadic `comp` does
the function of many many different combinators in
clojure. ([blackbird is supposed to be
BBB](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39500777), but it seems a
single `comp` already does the job).


```
(defn over [g h]
  (fn
    ([w]   (g (h w)))
    ([a w] (g (h a) (h w)))))
```
