title: number of concepts
categories: [programming]

Some time ago I read a quote/sentence like:

    Something something "quality of code/software is inversely proportional to the number of concepts/abstractions it uses/invents/manages."

This seems like an idea from Wirth, or OilShell, or Perlis, or
Iverson.  But I can't find the right reference. Of course, it's also
an idea from Thompson, and many others, but can't find exactly where I
read it.

The link I find in my history is
https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Perlis-Thompson-Principle , but
it doesn't mention that quote.
