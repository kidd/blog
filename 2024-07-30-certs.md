I just read [an article](https://www.pixelstech.net/article/1722045726-All-I-Know-About-Certificates----Certificate-Authority) about certificates that's pretty nice and to the point. It reminded me about an epic [smallstep blogpost about pki](https://smallstep.com/blog/everything-pki/) I found years ago, and also a [video tutorial about pgp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq-yKJFHJpk) I used long time ago to figure out all that certificates jazz.

Anyway, I always feel that I haven't interiorized those concepts
enough because if I would, I'd probably find more places to use it (you know... nails and hammers)
