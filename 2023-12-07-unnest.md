title: Unnest arrays from multiple rows

Once you start moving off of the classic relational model in a sql
database and start using arrays you keep needing to put an array back
into a table when further dealing with the values.

A basic case is when using an array of values from your programming language into a sql query.

That's how I usually do it:

```sql
with users as (select id::uuid from unnest(?) as id)
select id from users;
```

Another common usecase for arrays is when aggregating values in a
group by. There you got to different groups bucketed in different
arrays, and you may want to get a subset of them in table form:


```sql
with users as (select status, count(*), array_agg(id) as ids from users group by status)
  select unnest(ids) from (select ids from users where status in ('active', 'inactive')) as t;
```

It's a nice pattern to keep in mind, while reminding that functions
can usually run in the "from" side, but also in the "select" side.
